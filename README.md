# Self-transformable-quadruped
As legged robots are suitable to be used in unstructured environments, it becomes a popular field of research
nowadays. ​These robots have many abilities, of which the most unique one is mobility. Many challenging tasks have
been performed by mobile robots of many different designs. The terrain over which, these robots must be able to
move is often uneven, slippery or muddy, which gives rise to many challenges, particularly stability.​ In this project,
we are going to design a self transformable quadruped which would be able to overcome the unstructured terrains in
environments. This robot will transform itself into the best form according to the external environment around it. It
can walk on four legs, crawl on rough surfaces, can climb at a particular height (less than 15 cm), can climb on
slopes(less than 40 )and undergo narrow passage(greater than 7cm). Such types of robots can be used at such
°
places where human reach is not possibles planetary exploration or any other rescue operation. In this way, it would
be helpful for society as well as the technological advancement of our country.
